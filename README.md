features I plan to implement: 

✓ Food tracking: Allow users to log the foods they eat, including information about calories, macronutrients (protein, fat, and carbohydrates).

✓ Meal planning: Give users the ability to plan their meals in advance, either by selecting from a pre-populated list of meals or by creating their own custom meals.

• Barcode scanning: Use a gem like "barby" or "barby-barcode" to allow users to scan the barcode of a packaged food item to automatically populate nutritional information.

• Recipe tracking: Allow users to track the nutritional information of homemade meals by entering the ingredients and quantities used in the recipe.

• Water intake tracking: Give users the ability to track their daily water intake, which can help them stay hydrated and feel their best.

• Progress tracking: Allow users to see their progress over time, either through graphs or other visual aids.

• Social features: Allow users to connect with friends and family members who are also using the app, so they can motivate each other and share progress.


As for gems, here are some that I plan to include in this project.

• "Devise" for user authentication and authorization.
• "Shrine" for file uploads, which users could use to upload photos of their meals(or recipes?).
• "Chartkick" for generating graphs and other visual aids.
• "RSpec" for testing the application.
• "CanCanCan" for role-based authorization.
• "ActiveAdmin" for creating an admin dashboard for managing user data.
